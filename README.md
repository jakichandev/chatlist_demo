# Chat-list demo app

## First step

Install dependencies typing `npm install` or `yarn install`

## Second step

Test application typing `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

### Recommendations

I have created fake data using json-server, you need json-server as dependency to start the application.
If you don't have json-server install json-server typing `npm install -g json-server` or `yarn add json-server -G` in your terminal.
You can customize data or add users with their own properties modifying the file located in "/data/db.json".
